# Completed-Machine-Learning-project-with-Logistic-Regression
Complete approach to go with for a ML model

# Summary of Work done

#1. Data normalized and checked for any null values
#2. Different visualizations are performed to understand the data
#3. Catagorized target data converted in to non catagorical
#4. Data Splitted for Training and Testing (Validation is not considered)
#5. Logistic Regression model applied and accuracy computed
#6. Feature reduction carried out through pearson correlation coefficient
#7. Logistic Regression applied on reduced feature set and the accuracy has been improved
#8. Hyper Parameter tuning performed for logistic regression
#9. with the tuned parameter,  logistic regression model accuracy was further incresed
#10. k-fold statergy is applied  with tuned C value
#11. Other regression measures such as F1, R2, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix are computed.
